This repository contains a minimal example that shows how to use ECDSA signatures on the Aleo blockchain.

See [main.leo](./src/main.leo) for the Leo code and [generate_signature.js](./generate_signature.js) for the JavaScript code to generate the signature.

After successfully executing the transition and seeing it get accepted you can try altering one of the message bytes and see that it gets rejected.
